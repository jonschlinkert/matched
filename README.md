> Adds array support to node-glob, sync and async. Also supports tilde expansion (user home) and resolving to global npm modules.

Please consider following this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert), and consider starring the project to show your :heart: and support.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save matched
```

## Usage

If non-glob patterns (e.g. file paths) are passed, only paths that exist on the file system are returned.

```js
const glob = require('matched');
```

**promise**

```js
glob(['*.txt'])
  .then(files => console.log(files)) //=> ['a.txt', 'b.txt', 'c.txt']
  .catch(console.error)

// or with async-await
(async function() {
  
const files = await glob('*.txt');

})();
```

**sync**

```js
const files = glob.sync(['*.js']);
//=> ['utils.js', 'index.js']
```

**callback**

```js
glob(['*.js'], (err, files) => {
  console.log(files);
  //=> ['utils.js', 'index.js']
});
```

**options**

All methods take [node-glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) options as the second argument:

```js
const glob = glob(['*.js'], { cwd: 'test' });
//=> ['test.js']
```

## Release history

**v0.4.1**

* Exposes a non-enumerable `cache` property on the returned files array. This is a patch relase since the property does not change the existing API and should not otherwise effect behavior or results.
